#---Pseudcode Each line will correspond to a froggy language statement---
#the parser includes a few extra print statements for readability
#however the point of this project was to be able to create
#the language, I was purposfully trying to make this unreadable
#for the sake of my own amusment. 

#frog = 8;
#output(frog);
#bruh = 9.1;
#output((int)bruh);
#equ = 10 // 3 + 12 * (frog - bruh);
